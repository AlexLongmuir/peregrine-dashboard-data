## Summary
Implement a single typed networking layer for the iOS app that targets the existing Next.js `/api/*` backend, automatically injects the current Supabase access token, provides Codable models + typed route wrappers for core entities, and proves end-to-end by fetching the authenticated Dreams list. Add unit tests for request construction, auth header injection, decoding, and non-2xx error
