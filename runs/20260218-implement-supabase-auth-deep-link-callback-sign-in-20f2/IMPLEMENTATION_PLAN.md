## Summary
Implement end-to-end Supabase authentication for iOS (SwiftUI): add Supabase Swift SDK, load config from `Info.plist`, persist/restore session, handle auth callback deep links (`regretless://auth-callback`), provide native Sign in with Apple, expose a single access-token retrieval API for backend `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and switch between login and authenticated placeholder UI
