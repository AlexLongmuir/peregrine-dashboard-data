## Summary
Implement full Supabase-based auth for iOS (SwiftUI): add Supabase Swift SDK, initialize client from `Info.plist` config, persist/restore session across restarts, handle auth callback deep links via `regretless://auth-callback`, and provide a minimal UI with native Sign in with Apple, authenticated placeholder screen, and sign out. Expose a single async API to retrieve the current acces
