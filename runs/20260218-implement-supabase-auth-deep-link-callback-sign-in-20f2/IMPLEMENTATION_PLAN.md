## Summary
Implement end-to-end Supabase auth on iOS with session persistence, deep-link callback handling, and native Sign in with Apple. Provide a minimal SwiftUI login screen and authenticated placeholder screen, plus a single API to retrieve the current `Bearer` access token for backend requests. Configuration is read from `Info.plist` (no hardcoded secrets) and fails fast in Debug if missing.
