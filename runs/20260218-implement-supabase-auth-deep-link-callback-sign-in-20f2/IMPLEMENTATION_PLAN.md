## Summary
Implement end-to-end Supabase authentication for iOS (SwiftUI): add Supabase Swift SDK, initialize client from `Info.plist` config, persist/restore session, handle auth callback deep links via `regretless://auth-callback`, provide native Sign in with Apple, expose a single access-token retrieval API for backend `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and build minimal login/authenticated place
