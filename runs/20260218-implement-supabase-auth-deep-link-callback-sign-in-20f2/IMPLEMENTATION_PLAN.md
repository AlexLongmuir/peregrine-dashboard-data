## Summary
Implement end-to-end Supabase auth for iOS (SwiftUI): add Supabase Swift SDK, initialize client from `Info.plist` config, persist/restore session, handle auth callback deep links (`regretless://auth-callback`), provide native Sign in with Apple, expose a single access-token retrieval API for backend Bearer auth, and switch between login and authenticated placeholder UI with sign-out.
