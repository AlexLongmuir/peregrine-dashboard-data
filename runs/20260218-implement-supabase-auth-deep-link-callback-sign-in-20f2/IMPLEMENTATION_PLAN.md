## Summary
Implement end-to-end Supabase authentication for iOS (SwiftUI): integrate Supabase Swift SDK, load config from `Info.plist`, persist/restore session, handle auth deep-link callbacks (`regretless://auth-callback`), provide native Sign in with Apple, expose a single access-token retrieval API for backend `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and build minimal login/authenticated placeholder UI
