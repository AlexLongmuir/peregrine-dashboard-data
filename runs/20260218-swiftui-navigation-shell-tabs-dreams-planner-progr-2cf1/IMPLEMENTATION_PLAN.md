## Summary
Implement a SwiftUI navigation shell that mirrors the RN app: a `TabView` with 4 tabs (Dreams, Planner, Progress, Account), each tab owning an independent `NavigationStack` + `NavigationPath` that preserves state across tab switches. Add placeholder root screens and a Planner “Today Details” push. Add centralized deep link handling via `onOpenURL` to select tabs and (for one route) push
