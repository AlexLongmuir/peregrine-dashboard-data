## Summary
Rebuild the mobile-only “Next Races” carousel on the Sports Homepage to be an exact visual + behavioral replica of the carousel on https://www.spreadex.com/sports/mobile/homepage (June 2024 reference). Keep existing data source/selection logic, but replace markup, styling, and interactions. Add skeleton loading, empty/error/offline states, accessibility, and Mixpanel telemetry.
