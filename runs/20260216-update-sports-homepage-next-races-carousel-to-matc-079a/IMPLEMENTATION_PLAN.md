## Summary
Replace the existing mobile-only “Next Races” carousel on the Sports Homepage with a pixel/behavior-identical replica of the Spreadex mobile homepage carousel (June 2024 reference). Keep the existing data source, but rework markup, styling, interactions, states (loading/empty/error/offline), accessibility, and add Mixpanel telemetry.

## Steps
1. **Capture reference implementation**
