Verdict: FAIL

## Manual QA required
- Visual parity vs Spreadex reference (layout, spacing, typography, colors, icons, transitions, chevrons presence/behavior) on real mobile devices.
- Touch scrolling feel (momentum, snap, overscroll) and chevron behavior (if implemented) compared to reference.
- Focus styles visibility on mobile + external keyboard (iOS/Android) to confirm “visible focus states
