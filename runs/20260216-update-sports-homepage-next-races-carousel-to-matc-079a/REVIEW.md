Verdict: FAIL

## Manual QA required
- Visual parity vs Spreadex reference (layout/spacing/typography/colors/icons/animations) **once** the functional gaps below are fixed.
- Confirm chevrons exist/behave exactly like reference (if reference has them) after implementation is added.
- Confirm mobile-only behavior in responsive breakpoints on real devices (once gating is corrected/verified).
