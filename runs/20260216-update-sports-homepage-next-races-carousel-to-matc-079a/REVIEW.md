Verdict: FAIL

## Manual QA required
- Visual parity vs Spreadex reference (card sizing, spacing, typography, colors, icons, shadows, transitions, chevrons) — cannot be proven from diff alone.
- Touch scroll feel/momentum + chevron behavior parity — requires device testing.
- Focus ring visibility and keyboard navigation behavior on mobile Safari/Chrome — requires manual verification.
