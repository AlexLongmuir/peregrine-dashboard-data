Verdict: FAIL

## Manual QA required
- Visual parity vs Spreadex reference (card sizing, spacing, typography, colors, icons, chevrons, transitions) — cannot be proven from diff alone.
- Touch scroll feel + chevron behavior parity (momentum, snap, disabled states) — requires device testing.
- Focus styles visibility on real devices (iOS/Android) — requires manual verification.
